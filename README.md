### 5. Connect Your Arduino

- Connect your Arduino Uno to your computer using a USB cable.
- Make sure to install any necessary drivers if your system prompts you.

### 6. Open the Arduino IDE

If you haven't installed the Arduino IDE yet, download it from the official [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

- Launch the Arduino IDE.
- Open the extracted folder and locate the main project file (it should have a "*.ino*" extension).
- Open this file in the Arduino IDE.

### 7. Upload the Code

- Select your Arduino board type from the "Tools" menu.
- Choose the correct COM port your Arduino is connected to.
- Click on the "Upload" button (the right arrow icon) to transfer the code to your Arduino.

### 8. Connect the HC-05 Bluetooth Module

- Connect the HC-05 module to your Arduino according to the provided circuit diagram in the documentation.
- Ensure that you have power and data lines connected properly for communication.

### 9. Test Your Robot

After the code uploads successfully, your robot should be ready. Use your smartphone or any Bluetooth-compatible device with a suitable app to control your robot. Follow the instructions in the app to connect to your HC-05 module.

## ⚙️ Configuration

To customize your robot, you may want to adjust parameters like PID settings or servo movements. Open the "*.ino*" file in the Arduino IDE and locate the relevant sections. Make changes as needed, then upload your modified code again.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, here are some common solutions:

- **Problem**: The robot does not move.
  - **Solution**: Check the connections to the motors and power supply.
  
- **Problem**: Bluetooth connection fails.
  - **Solution**: Ensure your phone is compatible and that you have the correct app.
